Assignment 1 - Abstract

	. 
Use tweeter data and open data related to Solar installations in California and New York as well as US Census data to create sentiment analysis and location analysis for Solar Energy and Green Energy opportunities, attempting to select the best location for opening a Solar Installation sales office where the consumers are receptive of Solar Panels and where the opportunity size for solar installation growth is worth the cost of a new office.
The analysis will consist of world counts, solar penetration analysis, and population size. The data will be loaded to hive and the queries and majority of the analysis will be conducted there.
There will also be some analysis and visualization created in R, mainly for world cloud and sentiment analysis as there are already packages for this purposes.
Tableau will also be a tool used to visualize geographic location and data points associated.
